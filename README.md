Responsive Design Demo
=====================
This is a simple one page site created to demonstrate responsive design. 

Features include:
1. Menu that goes from full-width all the way down to 'hamburger icon' using jQuery.
2. Feature image that resizes with the page
3. Youtube video that resizes with the page
4. Text that changes from two columns to one column as page gets smaller.

Responsive design involves using css media queries, device-width meta tags, and percentages instead of fixed-width columns. 
I created this demo in about two hours. The goal was to see how quickly I could create something that utilized all these aspects. The goal was not to make something 'pretty', but simply to demonstrate the principles of responsive design.
